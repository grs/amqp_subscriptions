Extended Semantics for Topic Subscriptions in AMQP: A Proposal
==============================================================

Examples
--------

The broker.py script implements a very simplistic pub-sub broker
against which the following examples can be run:

a.py:: A simple non-shared, non-durable subscriber. Multiple instances
can be run concurrently and each should get all messages. When not
attached, no messages are stored.

b.py:: A non-shared, durable subscriber with a container scoped
subscription identifier. Only one instance of the subscriber can be
run at a time with the default settings. However the container-id or
the subscription-id can be changed via command line arguments to cause
a different subscription to be used.

c.py:: A non-shared, durable subscriber with a global subscription
identifier. Only one instance of the subscriber can be run at a time
with the default settings. However the subscription-id can be changed
via a command line argument to cause a different subscription to be
used. The container id can also be explicitly set through a command
line argument, but this will not affect the subscription attached to.

d.py:: A shared, non-durable subscriber with a container scoped
subscription identifier. Multiple instances can be attached to the
same subscription at one time and the messages for that subscription
should be divided between them. To attach to the subscription the same
container id and link name[1] must be used. If there are no active
consumers attached to the subscription, it is deleted and messages are
not stored for it.

e.py:: A shared, non-durable subscriber with a global subscription
identifier. Multiple instances can be attached to the same
subscription at one time[1] and the messages for that subscription should
be divided between them. To attach to the subscription only the link
name is considered.

f.py:: A shared, durable subscriber with a container scoped
subscription identifier. Multiple instances can be attached to the
same subscription at one time[1] and the messages for that subscription
should be divided between them. The subscription can survive the
detachment of all active consumers and will continue to store
messages.

g.py:: A shared, durable subscriber with a global subscription
identifier. Multiple instances can be attached to the same
subscription at one time[1] and the messages for that subscription should
be divided between them. To attach to the subscription only the link
name is considered. Again, the subscription can survive the detachment
of all active consumers and will continue to store messages.


[1] A link name may have a special suffix added to ensure uniqueness
for a given container-id(/connection) without altering the subscription it
identifies. For the purposes of identifying a subscription, anything after
and including a '!' character in the link name is ignored.
